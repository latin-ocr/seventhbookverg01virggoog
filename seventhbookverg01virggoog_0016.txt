PREFACE.

ΑΝ important change „is slowly taking place in clas·
sical instruction in this country. It is well known that,
ι as classical education hasbeen conducted in our schools
and colleges, it has not qualified students, alter a course
of training lasting froin six to ten years, to read Latin
and Greek with any facility. As a natural consequence
the reading ot Latin and Greek seldom outlives college

· days, and the educated American remains virtually unac-

quainted at first hand with the classic authors. But has
he not gained, through the mental discipline of all this
study, a degree ot power and culture worth all the time
and labor it has cost? He tries to believe it, but he is
more or less conscious that it may be a delusion. To the
unprejudiced mind it does appear that amethod which,
after several years of application, leaves the student of a
language helpless at the threshold ot its literature,
must be singularly mistaken in its aims, or else that it
must be worked out in a very blundering and futile man-
ner. There can be no doubt that the fault has not been
in the application of a method, but in the end which
teachers and students have proposed to themselves.
The acquisition of a fairly wide and familiar acquaint-
ance with ancient literature, has been subordinated in
actual instruction to other ends.
