15 exaudiri: gemitus iraeque is the subject. The infinitives
saevire and ululare in 18 are similarly used. The infinitive so
used, with subject in the nominative, is called the historical
infinitiva but would be better named descriptive infinitiva “lt
presents to the hearer or reader a picture of a transient state
of things, or of a rapid succession of acts, without referring
them to any particular time.'' Madvig. gemitus iraeque:
gemitus irati. Look up hendtizdys in the Latin grammar. ln

Are there any other differences in the descriptions ol Homer
and Vergil? See reference on 11 above.
