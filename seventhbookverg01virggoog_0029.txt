has a misgiving‚ ior the oracle of Faunus, his prophetie sire, ¹
has declared that Lavinia is to wed a foreigner and become the
mother oi aposterity that shall rule the world. Accordingly,
when Aeneas sends an embassy with overtures ol iriendship,

the proffered alliance.

At this point, Juno again interposes to wreck the fortunes of
the hated Trojans. She sends Alecto, one oi the Furies, who
incites Amata to stir up the matrons of Latium, and afterwards
goads Turnus to vengeance. Iulus, too, while hunting, kills a
favorite stag, and thereby rouses Tyrrhus, keeper oi the royal

against the strangers. Remonstrance is unavailing, and the
aged king shuts himself up in his palace and lays down the
reins oi government.
