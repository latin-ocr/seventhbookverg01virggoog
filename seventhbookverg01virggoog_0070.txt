307 A difficult line, Conington makes quod scelus. . . me-
rentem = cuius sceleris poenas merentem, and translates
“And what had Lapithans or Calydon done to earn such penal
ruin?'' This seems to me erroneous. Quod scelus = ob quod
scelus, and tantum is the accusative of the lnner object, like
quid, 302 ; or, as it is commonly called, adverbial accusative. For
what crime deserved tlte Lapithae or Calydon sucle vengeance?
The pupil will find out the allusions in Smith’s Class. Dict.‚ and
he may read the story in relation to Calydon in a translation of
the Iliad, Bk. IX. 533 foll.

309 memet: the syllable met added to me for emphasis. quae . . .
verti: not referring to transformations3 she lras turned to every
shift. ’

315 attrahere, etc: fate can be delayed, but not averted‚ even by
the gods.

317 hac . . . mercede: atthis cost; ablative of price.

320-22 Cisseis: Hecuba; so called as daughter of Cisseus, king
oi Thrace. “The allusion is to the dream of Hecuba before
the birth of Paris. As she dreamed that her offsprlng would
be a fite-brand, and the cause of the destruction of Troy, so has
Venus brought forth in Aeneas a like offspring (idem) — one
attended with the same destiny, who shall in like manner, by
betrothing a ioreign princess‚ occasion disaster to the new or
restored Troy (Pergama recidiva) and thus he shall be a second
Paris.'’ Frieze. Translate: Nor evas Hecuba tlte only mother to
tecm witle fiee-brand and bring sortle neqttial flames. Neey Venus
laath sucle aeeotlzer offitpringsor lter own, another Para ancl again
