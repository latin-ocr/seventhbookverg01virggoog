I very well remember hearrng Dr. Francis Gardner‚
for forty years headmaster of the Boston Latin School‚
and one of the most noted classical teachers in this
country, say publicly that he deemed it of small import-
ance that a boy should be able, at the end of the six

years’ course in his school, to read Cicero or Xenophon. 3

What did he value as the outcome of so long a course oi
classical training? Why, a thorough knowledge of the
Latin and Greek grammars; Ι might almost say, of Latin
and Greek syntax.

Dr. Samuel Taylor was another schoolmaster oi still .

greater celebrity; and though the range of his instruction
was wider, Ι think he held views as to the-relative value

oi grammar similar to those of Dr. Gardner. These l

two, I repeat, were exceedingly able men, and their teach-
ing unquestionably represented the best and most ad-

vanced work done in preparatory schools. It is well ἵ

known that the methods of classical instruction in college
have not differed widely from those oi the schools.

There has been rather less parsing and rather oftener χ

some attempt at literary appreciation,--that is about all. ¹
Practically syntactical drill has usurpeda large part oi
the time of the so-called lecture hour. Very recently Ι

use of college students‚ and in the notes to one short
chapter,I counted twenty-three references to the syn-
tax of five Latin grammars. In fact, Syntax has been
the great god before which we classical schoolmasterS,
editors, and students have been wont to bow down.
Does this seem exaggerated language? Let me give
another illustration. Ι look into the notes of a school
