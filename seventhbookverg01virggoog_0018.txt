this country, and I estimate the grammatical references
in the first book, almost all on syntax, at between three
and four hundred. On the first twenty-five lines, ir I
count duplicatos there are sixty-four.

But there is better evidence than this that syntax has
been deemed the all-in-all. Compare the amount of an-
notation in the later books of authors read in schools,
with that of the earlier. Sometimes there is not a quar-
terso much, a fifth, or evena tenth. The shrinkage is
astonishing in almost all cases, What is the explanation?
Why, that aiter syntax has been thoroughly thrashed out
in the earlier books, there remains little need oi annota-
tion on the later. When all uses of the dative with
adjectives‚ the ablativo case, and the subjunctive mode

Harvard College has taken the lead in encouraging a
change ior the better, but m a too timid or hali-hearted
fashion. Candidates for admission are still notified in
the annual catalogue that they will be expected to answer
questions on syntax. As ii there could be any better test

Still there is progress. The most thoughtiul teaehers
in college' and out oi college, are coming to recognize the
