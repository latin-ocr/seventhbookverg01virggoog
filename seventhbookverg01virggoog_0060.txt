NOTES.

Τὴε occasional poetioel translations are quoted from Conington.

1 Tu quoque: who besides? See VI. 234, 381. The burial
place ol Caieta is now called Gaeta, a strongly fortified sea·
port forty miles northwest from Naples; that oi Misenus,
Punta di Miseno, that is, Promontory of Misenus3 that of
Palinurus, Punta di Palinuro. Aeneia nutrix: nurse of Aeneas.
See 10, below, for another example of an adjective formed from
a proper name, and used where we should employa noun with
‘of,’ or the possessive case.

3 servat: the primary meaning is keep, preserve. Whatisit in
Vl. 575? What in Vl. 507? Here the meaning is close to that
oi Vl. 507, keeps up the memory os, broods over. nomen: as
preserved in that of the city and promontory (note on 1), noi
as inscribed on a tomb. The words et nunc, referring to Ver-
gil’s time, still remain true.

‘⁸ Still glory haunts thy place oi rest.”

4 Hesperia: the origin, meaning, and application of the name
are interesting and should be studied. Look at Ι. 530 soll.
Why is magnaeo often coupled with it? si qua est ea gloria:
whatever glory that may be,· qua is nom, and ea is the subject.
What would a literal rendering be?

o aggere composito tumuli :tumulo composito, heaping up a
funeral mound.

ro Circaeae . . . terrae: see note on 1,Aeneia nutrix. Seewhat
Vergil calls the land of Circe in ΙΙΙ. 386. It is said to look
like an island from the sea, at a moderate distance from the
shore, but is, in fact, a promontory, now called Monte Circello.

rr With this description of Circe's palace it is well worth while
to compare the original, Odyssey X. 210 soll„ in Butcher and
Lang's or Palmer’s translation.

13 inlumina: ut lumina praeberet, sor lzght ; in often denotes

purpose.
