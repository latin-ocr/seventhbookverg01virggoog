NOTES.

759-60 “Thee, shepherd‚ thee the woods and desert caves

With wild thyme and the gadding vine o’ergrown,
And all their echoes moum.”
Milton, Lycidas.

753 eductum=educatum: reared. Egeriae lucis: there wasa
grove at Aricia, east of Rome, near Mt.·Albanus‚ sacred to
Egeria, as well as one near Rome. ’

764 pinguis: victimis abundans. The temple ot Diana at
Aricia was well known, being served by “the priest who slew
the slayer and shall himself be slain.”- Conington. Read in
F. W. Farrar’s “Darkness and Dawn’' a chapter entitled
“The King of the Grove‚'’ in which the custom above alluded
to is made the basis ot a thrilling scene.

765 hippolytum: subject acc. of venisse, 768. Read the article
“ Hippolytus ” in ‘Smith's Class. Dict.‚ or the description ot the
death of Hippolytus in a translation ot Euripides' play ot the
same name.

restored to lite; he was viriis!

778 templo: ablative after arcentur, 779.

780 effudere: the youth was spat, but not the chariot. Another
