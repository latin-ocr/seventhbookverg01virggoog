norea. 45

487-489 The order of the words is singularly confused. Adsue-
tum . . . ferum and omni . . . cura are to be taken with ornabat3
and mollibus . . . cornua sertis with intexens. terum: the
naturally wild creature is now manum patiens.

495 que: that is, the stag now defluebat, now levabat.

498. erranti = ita ut erraret: nor was a god absent, so that ln's
reghthand erred. Literally: nor was a god's presence wanting
to his erring hand.

5οο tecta: tlte homestead; more comprehensive than stabulis aud
tectum below. The latter probably means the herdsman's hut;
the former, that part ot it set off ior the stag.

501 questu: with replebat. '

505 olli: nominative, old form for illi. See 458.

507 stipitis gravidi nodis = stipite gravido nodis.

507-t3 quod. . .rimanti: with repertum supply est: whatever
wassound by each ene as he groped about.

509 coactis: the preposition is intensive, driven home ; not, as
Conington explains, ‘⁴ driven together, so as to meet in the centre.'’

510 spirans immane: panting with wilci rege. ,

511 The order might have been at saeva e speculis dea tempus
nacta nocendi, to advantage in cleamess.

513-14 cornuque. . . vocem: straining forth on crooked horn a
hellish blast.

515 profundae: take predicatively, to their inanest deptns.

516 Triviae: what is the meaning of the name? What other
names had Trivia?

518 Compare these two translations, the first Dryden's, the second
Conington's.

“ Young mothers wildly stare with iear possessed
And strain their helpless iniants to their breasts.'’

“And terror-stricken mothers pressed
Their children closer to their breast.'’

Find a better word to be substituted for one in the last line of
Conington's translation, and show why it is better.
519 bucina: the same as cornu above.
521 indomiti agricolae: try to translate so as to keep these words
in their position.
