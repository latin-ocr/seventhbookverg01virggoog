93 mactaret: there is a reading mactabat, found in most

it come about that this word, meaning a creature witb two
teeth‚ was used in the sense of ovis? The dictionaries are
unsatisfactory, but Dr. Henry, an ingenious and original com·
mentator on Vergil, supplies the answer: ‘⁴ The sheep, till it has
attained the age of one year, has a set of eight primary, or milk,
teeth; when the age of one year has been attained, the two
central of these eight teeth drop out, and are replaced by the
first two teeth oi the second or permanent set, which, being
. very large and conspicuous amidst the six remaining milk teeth
(originally much smaller and now greatly diminished by use and
absorption), the animal at first sight appears to have only two
teeth (sheep never having any teeth at all in the upper jaw);
hence the appellation bidens.” This condition of the teeth‚
Henry further states, does not continue after the completion of
the second year.
